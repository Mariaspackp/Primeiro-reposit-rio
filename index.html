  <h6>A drop in the ocean<h6>

    </p><h3>A change in the weather<h3><br>
    </h3>I was praying that you and me might end up together<h3><br>
    </h3>It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert<h3><br>
    </h3>But I'm holding you closer than most 'cause you are my heaven<h3><br>

    </p><h3>I don't wanna waste the weekend<h3><br>
    </h3>If you don't love me pretend<h3><br>
    </h3>A few more hours then it's time to go<h3><br>
    </h3>And as my train rolls down the east coast<h3><br>
    </h3>I wonder how you keep warm<h3><br>
    </h3>It's too late to cry<h3><br>
    </h3>Too broken to move on<h3><br>

    </p><h3>And still I can't let you be<h3><br>
    </h3>Most nights I hardly sleep<h3><br>
    </h3>Don't take what you don't need from me<h3><br>

    </p><h3>It's just a drop in the ocean<h3><br>
    </h3>A change in the weather<h3><br>
    </h3>I was praying that you and me might end up together<h3><br>
    </h3>Its like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert<h3><br>
    </h3>But I'm holding you closer than most 'cause you are my heaven<h3><br>

    </p><h3>Misplaced trust and old friends<h3><br>
    </h3>Never counting regrets<h3><br>
    </h3>By the grace of God I do not rest at all<h3><br>
    </h3>And New England as the leaves change<h3><br>
    </h3>The last excuse that I'll claim<h3><br>
    </h3>I was a boy who loved a women like a little girl<h3><br>

    </p><h3>And still I cant let you be<h3><br>
    </h3>Most nights I hardly sleep<h3><br>
    </h3>Don't take what you don't need from me<h3><br>

    </p><h3>Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore, no no<h3><br>
    </h3>Heaven doesn't seem far away<h3><br>
    </h3>Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore, no no<h3><br>
    </h3>Heaven doesn't seem far away, oh oh<h3><br>
